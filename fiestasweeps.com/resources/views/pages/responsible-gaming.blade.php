      <h2>Responsible Gaming</h2>

      <p>
        At Fiesta Sweeps, we believe gaming should be fun, exciting, and responsible. Our platform is designed for entertainment while ensuring a secure and fair gaming experience. We are committed to promoting responsible play and providing players with the tools they need to make informed gaming choices.
      </p>

      <h3>Gaming with Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Fiesta Sweeps is built on the foundation of fair sweepstakes entertainment. While players can enjoy our engaging games, we emphasize the importance of playing responsibly and maintaining a healthy balance between gaming and daily life.
      </p>

      <h3>Responsible Gaming Guidelines</h3>
      <p>To ensure a positive gaming experience, we encourage players to follow these best practices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Set Personal Limits</strong> – Establish limits on your play time and spending to maintain balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Chasing Losses</strong> – Never try to recover lost funds by playing more. Instead, view gaming as entertainment.</li>
        <li><strong>Play Within Your Means</strong> – Only participate with funds that do not affect your financial obligations.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintain Life Balance</strong> – Gaming should complement, not interfere with, your work, responsibilities, and relationships.</li>
        <li><strong>Take Breaks</strong> – Regular breaks help maintain a healthy mindset and prevent excessive play.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Self-Assessment Questions</h3>
      <p>If you are uncertain whether gaming is becoming a concern, consider the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does gaming affect your responsibilities or relationships?</li>
        <li>Have you ever felt the urge to recover losses by playing more?</li>
        <li>Have you borrowed money to fund your gaming?</li>
        <li>Do you rely on gaming for income?</li>
        <li>Is setting gaming limits difficult?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you answered "YES" to any of these, you may want to evaluate your gaming habits or seek support.</p>

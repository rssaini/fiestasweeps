      <h2>Refund & Transaction Policy</h2>
      <p class="effective">Last Updated: May 19, 2025</p>

      <p>
        At Fiesta Sweeps, transparency and integrity guide our approach to player transactions. This policy outlines how we manage payments, withdrawals, and financial disputes. By accessing our services, you acknowledge and accept the following terms.
      </p>

      <h3>No Credit Extensions or Financial Guarantees</h3>
      <p>
        Fiesta Sweeps does not extend credit or front funds for participation. All activity on our platform must be funded with cleared, deposited balances. Users are expected to manage their play responsibly, understanding that participation involves the potential loss of deposited funds. We do not cover losses, and funds lost during gameplay will not be refunded under any circumstance.
      </p>

      <h3>Transaction Finality & Dispute Prevention</h3>
      <p>
        All confirmed deposits are considered final. By submitting a payment, you agree not to revoke or reverse it through chargebacks, disputes, or unauthorized cancellations. Attempting to recover payments via your bank or payment provider without legitimate cause violates this policy and may result in permanent account suspension. If a reversal occurs, you are required to repay the full amount and any related recovery fees. Any rewards earned from reversed funds will be forfeited.
      </p>

      <h3>Withdrawing Funds from Your Account</h3>
      <p>
        Fiesta Sweeps supports cashing out eligible balances in accordance with verification protocols. To withdraw, users must:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Meet the minimum threshold amount</li>
        <li>Pass identity verification steps</li>
        <li>Be compliant with platform guidelines and anti-fraud rules</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to delay or deny withdrawal requests until all requirements are satisfied.
      </p>

      <h3>System Glitches, Bugs, and Errors</h3>
      <p>
        We aim to provide a stable and fair gaming environment. However, technical malfunctions can occur. If any part of the system misbehaves â€” including but not limited to entry errors, gameplay disruptions, or payout miscalculations â€” affected entries may be invalidated. Players must report any suspected issues immediately. Fiesta Sweeps is not responsible for losses tied to software faults or network interruptions. We may take appropriate action to correct or cancel impacted activity.
      </p>

      <h3>Limitation of Responsibility</h3>
      <p>
        While we strive to maintain a secure and reliable platform, Fiesta Sweeps is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential losses resulting from use of our services. This includes losses due to user error, internet connectivity issues, third-party service outages, or violations of platform rules. Our liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.
      </p>

      <h3>Updates to This Policy</h3>
      <p>
        Fiesta Sweeps may revise this Refund & Transaction Policy as our platform evolves. Any changes will be posted here and are effective immediately upon publication. Your continued use of the site indicates your acceptance of any updates. If you disagree with the current or modified terms, you must cease use of the platform.
      </p>
